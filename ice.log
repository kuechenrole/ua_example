    Experiment: MismipPlus-iceOceanN_t  
    Time-dependent restart run.  
    Running on: prod-0304
 ***************************************************************************** 
 


 ---------  Reading restart file RestartMismipPlus-iceOceanN_t.mat.
Number of integration points: nip=6 niph=6 
 Starting restart run at t=1030.1 with dt=0.0025 
 Note: Even though this is a restart run the following variables are defined at the beginning of the run
       through calls to corresponding user-input files: rho, rhow, g, C, m, AGlen, n, as, and ab.
       These will overwrite those in restart file.
 ---------   Reading restart file and defining start values for restart run is now done.

  INFO: The function sparse2 is not known to your matlab installation.
Matlab in-built sparse function used instead.
 Consider installing SuiteSparse as this might speed up the runs.
